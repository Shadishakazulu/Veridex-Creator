# Veridex: Investor Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Cover Slide

**Title:** Veridex: The Proof Layer for Content + AI

**Subtitle:** Cryptographic proof of authenticity for creators, enterprises, and platforms

**Tagline:** "Trust through cryptography. Authority through proof."

## Slide 2: The Problem

### The Crisis
- **86%** of consumers concerned about AI-generated content
- **$500B+** potential liability for AI-generated content
- **Misinformation** costs global economy $2.7 trillion annually
- **Creator Economy** worth $104B but lacks proof infrastructure

### Current Solutions Are Broken
- No cryptographic proof of authenticity
- No legal framework for admissibility
- No insurance for content liability
- No verification layer for AI-generated content

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM:** $47.3B
- **Creator Economy:** $104B
- **AI Governance:** $12.5B
- **Enterprise Compliance:** $15.8B

## Slide 3: The Solution

### Veridex: The Proof Layer

**What We Do:**
- Generate cryptographic proofs of content authenticity
- Provide legally admissible verification
- Enable proof-based insurance
- Verify AI-generated content origin

**How It Works:**
1. Content hashing (SHA-256)
2. Digital signature (ECDSA)
3. Trusted timestamping (RFC 3161)
4. Blockchain anchoring (optional)
5. Immutable audit trail

**Why It Matters:**
- Immutable proof of authenticity
- Legally admissible in court
- Enables insurance products
- Verifies AI content origin
